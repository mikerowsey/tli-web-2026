# Host: your-domain.com
# Username: your-siteground-username
# Password: your-siteground-password
# Port: 21 (FTP) or 22 (SFTP)

# Upload all files from out/ to public_html/
```

### Option C: Git Integration (If Available)

4. Upload new out/ folder contents to SiteGround
```

### Performance Optimization
- Enable SiteGround CDN (if available)

- Optimize images before upload
- Use SiteGround's built-in optimization tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

## Future Considerations

### When to Consider Upgrading:
- Traffic exceeds SiteGround plan limits
- Need for server-side rendering (SSR)
- Requirement for API routes or databases
- Global CDN performance becomes critical

### Hybrid Approach:
- Keep main site on SiteGround
- Use Vercel free tier for interactive tools
- Subdomain setup: tools.tokistar.com â†’ Vercel
