# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## ðŸ§ª Deploy to Development (rowsey.org)

Use rowsey.org for all development, testing, and client reviews before going to production.

### **Step 1: Prepare rowsey.org (First Time Only)**

#### **A. Clear Old WordPress Site**

1. **Login to SiteGround**
   - Go to https://my.siteground.com
   - Select your hosting account
   - Click "Site Tools"

2. **Access File Manager**

#### **B. Verify Deployment Configuration**

Check that `scripts/deploy.sh` has the correct domain:

```bash
DEPLOY_DOMAIN="rowsey.org"
```

### **Step 2: Build and Deploy**

```bash
# Build and create deployment package
npm run deploy
```

This creates a zip file in `dist/` folder (e.g., `tokistar-deploy-20251031_153000.zip`)

### **Step 3: Upload to SiteGround**

1. **Open File Manager**
   - Site Tools â†’ File Manager
   - Navigate to: `/home/username/rowsey.org/public_html/`

2. **Upload Package**
   - Click "Upload" button

   - Wait for upload (~10 seconds for ~300KB file)

3. **Extract Files**
   - Right-click the uploaded zip file
   - Select "Extract"
   - Choose "Extract to current directory"
   - Wait for extraction (~5 seconds)

4. **Clean Up**
   - Right-click the zip file
   - Select "Delete"

5. **Verify File Structure**
   ```
   public_html/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ _next/
   â”œâ”€â”€ catalog/
   â”œâ”€â”€ sales-agents/
   â”œâ”€â”€ downloads/
   â”œâ”€â”€ products/
   â””â”€â”€ videos/
   ```

### **Step 4: Test Development Site**

Visit these URLs and verify everything works:

- **Homepage**: https://rowsey.org
- **Product Catalog**: https://rowsey.org/catalog
- **Sales Agents**: https://rowsey.org/sales-agents

**Test Checklist:**

- [ ] Navigation menu works (mobile and desktop)
- [ ] Product catalog search and filters work
- [ ] Sales agents directory filters work
- [ ] All images load correctly
- [ ] No console errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on phone or DevTools)

### **Step 5: Iterate and Improve**

Make changes locally, then redeploy:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to code
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Deploy to rowsey.org
npm run deploy

# 4. Upload new zip (overwrites previous version)
# 5. Test on rowsey.org
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Deploy to Production (tokistar.com)

Only deploy to production when rowsey.org is perfect and approved.

### **Step 1: Backup Current tokistar.com**

**CRITICAL**: Always backup before deploying to production!

1. **Create Backup**
   - Site Tools â†’ Backups
   - Click "Create Backup"
   - Wait for completion
   - Note the backup name/date

2. **Alternative: Download Files**
   - File Manager â†’ tokistar.com/public_html/
   - Select All â†’ Download
   - Save locally as backup

### **Step 2: Update Deployment Configuration**

Edit `scripts/deploy.sh` line 6:

**Change FROM:**
```bash
DEPLOY_DOMAIN="rowsey.org"
```

**Change TO:**
```bash
DEPLOY_DOMAIN="tokistar.com"
```

### **Step 3: Build Production Package**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

New zip file created with tokistar.com configuration.

### **Step 4: Clear tokistar.com WordPress**

1. **Access File Manager**
   - Site Tools â†’ File Manager
   - Navigate to: `/home/username/tokistar.com/public_html/`

2. **Delete All Files**
   - Click "Select All"
   - Click "Delete"
   - Confirm deletion

3. **Delete WordPress Database**
   - Site Tools â†’ MySQL â†’ Databases
   - Delete tokistar.com WordPress database

### **Step 5: Upload New Site**

Same process as development:

1. Upload zip to tokistar.com/public_html/
2. Extract files
3. Delete zip file
4. Verify file structure

### **Step 6: Test Production Site**

**Immediately test** after deployment:

- **Homepage**: https://tokistar.com
- **Product Catalog**: https://tokistar.com/catalog
- **Sales Agents**: https://tokistar.com/sales-agents

**Production Checklist:**
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Search and filters work
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] SSL certificate valid (https://)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Email still working (send test email)

### **Step 7: Monitor**

After deployment:
- Watch for user feedback
- Monitor Google Analytics (if configured)
- Check for any error reports
- Verify email continues working

### **Step 8: Update for Future Deploys**

After production deploy, change `scripts/deploy.sh` back to rowsey.org:

```bash
DEPLOY_DOMAIN="rowsey.org"  # Back to development
```

This way future updates go to rowsey.org first for testing.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### **Site Not Loading After Deployment**

**Problem**: Blank page or 404 error

**Solutions**:
1. Verify index.html exists in root of public_html
2. Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
3. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode
5. Check that extraction didn't create nested folders

### **Assets Not Loading**

**Problem**: Page loads but images/styles missing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify _next/ folder exists with content
2. Check browser console (F12) for 404 errors
3. Ensure all files uploaded completely
4. Check file permissions
5. Verify relative paths are correct

### **404 on Sub-Pages**

**Problem**: Homepage works but /catalog gives 404

**Solutions**:
1. Verify folder structure (catalog/index.html exists)
2. Check that folders were extracted properly
3. Ensure no .htaccess issues
4. Verify Next.js static export settings

### **SSL Certificate Warning**

**Problem**: "Not Secure" warning in browser

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for SSL auto-generation
2. Site Tools â†’ HTTPS â†’ Force HTTPS
3. Regenerate SSL certificate
4. Contact SiteGround support if persists

### **Old WordPress Still Showing**

**Problem**: Still seeing WordPress after deployment

**Solutions**:
1. Verify all WordPress files were deleted
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try different browser
4. Check correct domain folder on SiteGround
5. Ensure files extracted to root of public_html

### **Email Stopped Working**

**Problem**: Email not receiving after deployment
